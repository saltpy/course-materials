# Scripting with Python

## Objectives
1. Ability to read Python code up to moderate complexity;
2. Ability to manipulate key built in data types effectively;
2. Ability to solve simple novel problems with Python;
4. Ability to investigate errors and failures using simple techniques;
5. Ability to converse well with other Python programmers;
6. Ability to unittest with Python effectively;
7. Ability to write code in Python that is well factored and testable;
8. Ability to use appropriate library support.

## Outcomes
1. Distinction - 80%+:
    * Able to work to resolve own issues while producing consistently valuable code;
    * Code is well factored and shows evidence of appropriate unit testing;
    * Code almost always uses appropriate data types including definition of user types where appropriate;
    * Able to speak confidently about solutions with other Python programmers.
2. Merit - 60%+:
    * Able to communicate issues effectively and seek support as required;
    * Able to use inconsistently appropriate unittesting and code is sometimes well factored;
    * Able to use appropriate built in data types.
3. Pass - 40%+:
    * Able to write functioning python code which is useful in solving the problem;
    * Able to read python code and summarise its function.
4. Fail - 39%-:
    * Unable to show sufficent ability to read and write Python code.
