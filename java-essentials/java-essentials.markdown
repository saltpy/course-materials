#Java Essentials

##Objectives

1. Ability to read Java code;
2. Ability to write Java code to solve novel problems;
2. Ability to unit test Java code with JUnit;
3. Ability to use Eclipse to develop Java code;
4. Ability to write Java code that is well factored and testable;
5. Ability to use Maven to automate the build and test of Java code.

##Outcomes

1. Java;
  * Excellent;
    * the candidate possesses a confident ability to discuss relatively sophisticated constructs of the Java language such as Interfaces accurately while demonstrating some personal insight;
    * the candidate can produce Java code which is efficient, effective and well factored.
  * Good;
    * the candidate possesses some ability to discuss sophisticated Java constructs accurately;
    * the candidate can produce Java code which is effective but may lack signs of being well factored and may be somewhat inefficient.
  * Passing;
    * the candidate possesses confident ability to discuss simple Java concepts like methods;
    * the candidate’s Java code is largely effective though some minor errors may show in edge cases.
  * Failing;
    * the candidate demonstrates insufficient ability to discuss even simple Java concepts;
    * the candidate’s Java code is largely ineffective.
2. JUnit;
  * Excellent/Good;
    * the candidate demonstrates a good approach to using all major facets of JUnit eg BeforeClass.
  * Passing;
    * the candidate can use the most common facets of JUnit.
  * Failing;
    * the candidate demonstrates insufficient ability to use JUnit.
3. Eclipse;
  * Excellent/Good/Passing;
    * the candidate is able to use eclipse to develop java code.
  * Failing;
    * the candidate demonstrates insufficient ability to use Eclipse.
4. Composition, Abstraction and Inheritance;
  * Excellent;
    * the candidate is able to produce reliable abstractions with narrow focus;
    * the candidate is able to compose the abstractions to solve a number of distinct problems;
    * the candidate does not over rely on inheritance but does demonstrate understanding.
  * Good/Passing;
    * the candidate makes an effort to create abstractions;
    * the candidate makes an effort to use composition as a way to reuse code;
    * the candidate demonstrates understanding of inheritance.
  * Failing;
    * the candidate demonstrates insufficent ability to abstract, compose and inherit.
5. Maven;
  * Excellent/Good/Passing;
    * the candidate can automate the dependency gathering, build and test of a project using maven.
  * Failing;
    * the candidate demonstrates insufficient ability to automate the dependency gathering, build and test of a project using maven.
